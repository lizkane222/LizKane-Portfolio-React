How good does it feel to have your name remembered? How hard is it to remember the names of everyone you've met, especially those who could potentially become future advantageous connections. Ekseed is a social media application that prepares you to be a better and more informed networker. Networking requires not only the soft-skills of formal and informal interaction... but that you make each interaction memorable for yourself and for that individual. Leverage does this by encouraging you to make memorable notes on a person you've met, the next time you meet that person they'll feel great that you not only remember their name but also that their son plays HS football, their family skiis in Denver, they prefer coffee to tea, and are a Bronco's fan. Being memorable begins with remembering others. Each user creates their own network by essentially creating a new user (name, network category, company name, notes, contact info). A note taking application where each note is appended to that user. Beyond adding notes you can also add pieces of contact information. (Phone number, address, email addresses, company name, work address, work phone). Upload photo. Link to social media (to stay up to date on each individual). Share notes with others. View companies & who has a connection to that company.
