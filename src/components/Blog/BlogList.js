 blogP1: "I created this blog to be a descriptive illustration of the many facets of my personality and skills. Before becoming a software engineer I took time to explore who I am and what I love doing. Upon discovering software engineering, a collision took place between two areas; my need for creativity in work and my need for systematic order and purpose throughout all areas of life. The merging of these two have allowed me to embrace my somewhat unrelated skills and use them as pillars to further and deepen my skills in coding. I openly share these experiences and outlooks because it is not easy to know the experiences that have molded the mind behind the developer.",

 blogP1: " 	I remember being in fourth grade, so around 9 years old, making my first life-like sketch of one of my friends. When I had finished, I was amazed by what I had done. I was most proud of the line-work around the face and the hands, even though my proportions between the two were off, I felt immense joy. There was some burst of self-recognition in that moment of both pride and an idea that ‘this thing I’ve made is now a part of me. It hadn’t existed prior but now it’s as if I found some missing piece of myself.’ That one idea, or even feeling has ever since shaped much of the way I view the world. ",
 blogP2: "	I dabbled in painting with watercolors, charcoal, chalk and pastels, tried my hand at acrylic painting, but mostly I stuck with sketching. Years I spent chasing that feeling of creating something to discover new aspects of myself. There was always this place deep inside me that unified through the action of creating.",
 blogP3: "	The next period that defined my artistic life was upon taking a trip to Wyoming. It was an emotionally complex time of my life, as it is for many 16 year olds. I took my sketchbook, pencils, and a lawn chair out to the middle of grassy hills and posted up along a trail. I’m writing this 14 years later and I can still see the lines of those drawings. As always instructed by my art teachers, you spend nearly 80% of the time looking at the object and only 20% actually compiling the piece. I spent hours in different spots facing in different directions memorizing the landscapes of a place that meant very little to me at the time, but through sketching out those rolling hills, power lines, clouds, and grasslands there was an imprinting that took place that went far beyond the weighted lines of my pencils. ",
 blogP4: "	For Buddhists, the realm of meditation comprises mental states such as calm, concentration and one-pointedness (which comprises the six forces: hearing, pondering, mindfulness, awareness, effort and intimacy). The art of meditation or better yet, the meditation through art is like the twisting of radio knobs to find the clearest frequency of my own mind. There is something therapeutic about looking so long and deep at something and then pulling back to look at its simplest shapes and curves. Then the real therapy comes when forcing those shapes and curves onto a pad that not only represents what your eye can catch, but the chaotic thoughts to be hashed out with each stroke, blend, and erased mark. ",
 blogP5: "	Meditation is just a path towards liberation, awakening, mindfulness. Through sketching I journeyed through chaos to bring about order. Liberated from the puzzling and infuriating aspects of life finding closure to pain. In pouring my thoughts and heart into a piece I was unbound and released from whatever I felt imprisoned by at that moment. Liberation in creating, a.k.a. meditation, may be the one force to counteract spiritual gravity.",
 blogP6: "	Years and years have gone by and I’ve delved into drawing and painting with different motivations, sometimes creating to only then give it away, clawing out broad strokes to create a world on one of the many pages in my books. There were times when I never finished many works, as searching leads to discovery some worlds are flat with an edge to nowhere. In other words there was not a solution in the reality so how could there be an artistic one? But when I found that inspiring thought or photo to draw, I’d take ahold of it and get lost in its lights and shadows. I would take long lengths of hours and hours to paint the faintest details with the smallest paintbrush I could find. Truly I was searching for which drawing would be The accurate reflection of the world I’ve experienced and which would become a part of me. It’s like I was speed dating my way through art pieces looking to marry the one that complimented me most. To that end, I may always be a spinster.",
 blogP7: "	As adventurous as it is to always be discovering more of myself, it’s exhausting. I’ve stopped producing art for long periods of time because it’s emotionally draining to pour out and pour out and pour out. Even more so when I create pieces to just give them away… If my art could speak it’d be politely and timidly asking, ‘do you see me now?’, ‘do you understand me now?’, and most of all ‘in giving you this, I want you to know I see you and have spent hours thinking over you. In a way you’ve become a part of me, who I am as more than just an artist.’ ",

 index: 2,
 blogP1: "	I had just seen Titanic and fell in love with its theme song. Who didn’t right? There was this one night, I was sitting in my older sister’s bedroom on her office chair and we had the song on repeat, ‘my heart will go on an on.’ We belted out each line dramatically both seriously and humorously. I sat in that chair spinning and spinning around to no end, it was euphoric, it was timeless. I recount that night as being the night I discovered my love of singing. If you had asked my parents they’d tell you I had spent every moment before that singing instead of speaking, constantly making up songs, but this was the moment where I realized it for myself.",
 blogP2: "	The room with the spinning chair was in a house, and that house was complicated, my family lived there for many years yet this is my only true memory of me singing in that house. Singing had become a gauge of my happiness, there were times when it would just flow out and times I wouldn’t utter a sound. This was the same with certain places and people. I became aware of this inconsistency during a relationship in my teens. I was in a place where I thought I needed to break up and during a conversation with a friend I said, ‘I just don’t sing anymore, at least not when I’m with him.’ I was young and new to relationships but that realization forged a standard for all relationships that followed. ‘How do I know I’m with the right person? The answer, do I sing when I’m with them?’ It’s the simplest of measurements but is there a truer one in life than what naturally overflows in moments of joy and comfort? In my opinion no. ",
 blogP3: "	That next year was when I began writing songs, I took my older sister’s guitar and learned three chords. I was terrible, my fingers weren’t strong, my rhythm was more than lacking, but it was a collection of notes that gave me avenues to express my thoughts and ideas. My first song was a story from a few different perspectives of teenagers. For some reason I wasn’t embarrassed to sing it to my family and friends and did just that. With each new song I’d sit in my room learning two or three new chords just different enough to inspire avenues I had never expected to discover. In general I’m not a very emotional person, or at least I’d say so about myself. What I really mean is that my face may be overly-expressive, that which I wish I could control, but when it came down to my inner-thoughts those I rarely expressed to others; that was until I began writing. I allowed myself to feel and process things I wouldn’t have otherwise, all for the sake of the music. To get it out on paper I was purging myself of all of my complicated emotions and thoughts, and for the first time would untangle the mess and weave it into my own subjective truth.",
 blogP4: "	The whole process of song writing is something I think everyone should experience. In the beginning I came up with different techniques of writing, draw up chords first then write, write lines then modify them with chords, journal and pull out common threads, but the most truthful one: find chords and don’t plan, just sing. I had done this so many times that most of the songs I have sung weren’t ever written down, and they didn’t need to be because the pure experience flushed out the words I needed at that moment. I’d play and sing, dust off my hands and come out revived.",
 blogP5: "	I have a collection of dozens and dozens of songs, showing my different levels of maturity and whatever obsession rented out the space of my mind at that time. I have written songs of love, heartbreak, confusion, grief, hope, but if you looked throughout them they’d all have a common thread, me questioning why and the quest of finding the assurance I needed to go on. Why write songs? I don’t know any song writers who sit down to write and know exactly from start to finish what the song will be. The direction maybe, but the whole picture only comes about in its compilation. Each line, stanza, verse, and chorus holds different levels of truth. To find the truth you’ve got to set up camp until the fire goes out. Music metaphorically became the technique that cleansed me of life’s toxins. My songs pulse with the beat of my heart, forever gauging my happiness, dissatisfaction, and the landscape of experiences throughout my life. ",

 blogP1: "Possibility has always been my smelling salt, waking me up from any pit of life and raising me up in hope and curiosity. I love change, I love pushing beyond the edge of said limits to make a more interesting reality. Throughout my 11 week immersive software engineering bootcamp, I was often pushed back in my seat by all of the possibilities at every length of direction you could go in. The world was for the first time in my life yet to be fully discovered.",
 blogP2: "Most people don’t even know what a software engineer does, where to even begin explaining the tiny threads in the quilt of technology. My family even now still asks me what I want to do in this field, and I have so many answers that I struggle to make it succinct so that they can better grasp it. I often respond that I can literally do anything I want, not to state the obvious that every industry needs a software engineer, but that this was the one door I have been searching for my whole life. The path of endless possibility that can be steered by my passions, values, and interests. ",
 blogP3: "I went into my bootcamp with extreme anticipation, curiosity, and the knowledge that it’d be the hardest thing I’ve ever pushed myself to do. I spent every day and night building and understanding code. I had never felt more invigorated and like I had found my place in this world. The pandemic of Covid-19 was difficult for everyone, but throughout my program I found not only myself but a community of future devs surrounding me. Imposter syndrome is everyones loudest friend throughout a bootcamp like this, and even afterwards. I consider myself a confident person but even I became anchored down many times by the fear of not succeeding. What keeps me going is the possibility that I could make something with my own hands and mind that could really help people. Purpose is what I have and what I want to put into every application I work on.",
 blogP4: "I could spend and have spent every waking hour coding and learning new ways to develop applications. I see myself doing this in many capacities for the rest of my life. One day I see myself leading a team, developing my own start-up, and doing whatever I can to keep up with progress and stay ahead of irrelevance.

 blogP1: "Growing up I was fortunate enough to have had a pretty steady family life that allowed me certain freedoms such as traveling across the country and world, fearlessness in meeting new people, and feeling comfortable in a variety of situations. With that security I often found myself somewhere with a heart belonging elsewhere. I sat in a perpetual desire to go farther, meet culturally different people, and be amidst steady currents of daily life all the while steadily existing in a state of change. ",
 blogP2: "With an identity of being a “Texan” and then moving to Arizona while still very young, I always felt a dichotomy in belonging. As with every investigation of the many areas of life everything comes down to identity; if not on a full-fledged existential level then on miniature levels that form very specific aspects of our personality. ",
 blogP3: "Being nomadic is probably not a word that many people describe themselves as. Even I am hesitant to express it aloud, in fear of giving people the idea that I won’t be around long, that’s not my intent in the least bit. I am very unsettled at the idea of being settled. I am in my best form when things around me are uncertain. In states of uncertainty I am quick on my toes and confident in my own moves alone. So much so, that it’s provided me with a confidence and security that allows me to take risks, be vulnerable, and leave it all out there. ",
 blogP4: "I’ve moved homes every year for the past ten years, which is common for your twenties. But even before then, I had greater aspirations than were manageable for a teenager. This sense of always wanting to be elsewhere was not to say I was dissatisfied with my life at any of those stages, but that there was always hope and something in the next chapter to prepare for, long for, and seek out. The place was almost less important than the chance at experiencing life as it had never been thus far. New people, new languages, new food, new jobs, new skills, the list was potentially without limit, and as someone who loves to do everything and anything with some level of mastery, it was a bridge to unending growth and personal expansion.",
 blogP5: "I love comfort. Who doesn’t? Growing up playing seasonal sports year round, I developed an edge I think many athletes do which is to push yourself through the strain of training in order to gain strength, endurance, and ultimately reach a goal. I sought this strain out in every area of my life, always pushing myself to be better than I was yesterday. The goal was not always in sight but that exertion of will over difficult tasks, events, and circumstances was my preseason; and if every season is a new sport then it’s always preseason. This edge has contributed to my inflated dreams that seem daunting for some but have always been completely tangible to me.",
 blogP6: "I set a goal to attend university outside of my hometown, to move to France and support myself while doing so, to obtain a Masters degree, to delve into an immersive software engineering bootcamp. Each of these was at the time some of the most straining experiences of my life. This was mostly due to the fact that they took me out of my zone of comfort and brought me into a place that forced me to live each area of my life intentionally in order to reach that goal. It’s not so much that the goal is the goal. I know it’s a strange thing to say, but the goal is the celestial object with a strong enough gravitational force to send my life orbiting along its axis of purpose. Directionally forward enough to pull every aspect of my life into purpose and intentionality.",
 blogP7: "Belonging elsewhere is my way of setting my heart, mind, and body towards the future; sometimes a distant future that seems too grand an expectation for so many in my life… but there’s nothing like being aboard a rocket that is only subject to the forces of your own deepest desires. What good is rocket fuel if not to propel you further and faster than the expectations others have of you?",

 blogP1: "Imagination is only limited by how much you care for what others think of you. From third grade, I remember having my first desire to write stories, to be an author of mysteries and adventure. I read for pleasure and wrote the same. As I grew up I let other priorities take precedent and let this practice slip by the wayside. In 2017 I moved to France and began an adventure of complete transformation. I questioned every facet of my American life and reconstructed myself to be someone that mirrored my values and what I actually believed, not what others believed or thought about me. One way I processed this stage of radical change was through writing.",
 blogP2: "I remember being on the train from teaching at the university and feeling a need to write. I had a story I needed to begin telling, not to anyone specific but tell it I must. Once arriving in my city I found a local bar near the city square, bought a refreshing beer and spent two hours plugging away thoughts of characters, scenes, ideas, and problems. If there is any similarity between myself and any of my characters that’s by complete chance, I guess you can only process your thoughts through so many lenses before things start resembling reality. This first beer and keyboard date I had with myself led me into many repeated dates of researching concepts including but not limited to: astronomy, geology, general relativity, crimes against humanity, and population growth algorithms. Imagination has no ends so why should researching a book have them?",
 blogP3: "Honestly, I call myself a writer because I have a story that needs telling, needs expelling from my head. Just this week I developed a story I believe if told could potentially bridge or break many relationships in my life. Risk and vulnerability is what real writing is. You either hold onto what you know or let it go, all with the chance it may be hated, disregarded, thrown out, or even worse… loved. Who can ever be truly understood or known, there are certain mediums where truth rings clearer than you had ever consciously meant to process. This is the same with my art and music, a song or a drawing that needs to be told. ",
 blogP4: "I don’t know if I am a good writer or not, and honestly it’s not about any of that. Yes of course I’d love to be good at everything I do, but what I need from life and what I think life needs of me is to be real and honest with whatever medium is afforded me in the moment. To that end I allow myself to be slave to life, accepting the crazy ends of pain - love - and discovery - in order to process it all through whatever lens of imagination I can come up with. That does true justice to imagination, allowing it complete freedom in expression. ",

When I joined my first team sport at ten I don’t remember liking it in the least bit. But some two years later I joined the middle school volleyball team, basketball team, and softball team. Summers were spent at sports camps or watching warm Arizonan night softball games. There was a break between what I was doing and why I was doing it. I remember loving being around my team, a group of my friends where we had an excuse to spend hours of every weekday and some weekends playing sports. I remember loving to learn to do something new, like doing a reverse layup, rolling after digging a spike, catching a fly and throwing it home. These tasks were what I lived for.",
 blogP3: "I don’t remember a time in my life where my family didn’t make everything a competition or game. From age 6 my dad would hand me a map and we’d play ‘find that street’.  My family of six would race in our separate cars to be the first inside the house after any family outing. Games were woven into every aspect of daily life, and though I fed off the competition, I actually always hated how it made me feel to win or lose. I relished in the experience of bonding through a shared hardship, often video gaming or fort building and of course the intense hide-n-seek in the dark. It took me well into my twenties to actually realize I don’t like the competition of sports but the acknowledgement of friendship gained through playing sports.",
 blogP4: "I was always good at sports, but never the best. Maybe this is what allowed me to develop more artistic skills on the side. As a senior in high school, for the first time in my life, I was cut from a team. What was so centrically forged as my identity had been taken from me. I had lost games, tournaments, state semi-finals, but never felt failure on this level. I changed a lot over the following three months, turning inside-out searching for some sense in my world. When it came to basketball season I wasn’t the same person, was physically unable to mesh with my team in the same way I had the previous winter season, and was left feeling an even further separation from my “jock” identity. When it came to tennis season I had changed pretty drastically, but at least this sport had always allowed me to pick up and put down my competitiveness pretty easily.",

My sweet spot, the time I felt truest, liberated, and joyful were when I was peppering in volleyball with a friend, dancing around the court with just a basketball and my headphones, being in the sun volleying tennis balls just talking. These were the spaces in between, where no one usually places too much importance, where I discovered that curiosity and joy once again in not needing to question why but able to just do.",

Every eight year old girl is told they’ll have to one day shave their legs, their armpits, and many other places all for the sake of … wait what? Still no one can give me a good explanation for this. Because it was a French trend in the 1800s? Because the further from resembling a man the closer to a woman you’d be? Because men prefer it and if you want to please a man, your boyfriend, husband, gentleman caller then you must look the part?",
 blogP3: "There’s so much more to feminism than just fighting the patriarchy; though why not. A man can be and become anyone he wants, and even in today’s culture young girls are told they’ll make a beautiful bride , wife, mother one day. These compliments shouldn’t ruffle feathers, should they? The condescending idea of a woman being solely identified by her father, husband, child is so deeply ingrained in us and our culture that often we don’t even question the sincerity of it. It’s what’s kept women in the kitchen and out of higher education; keeping house while missing out on the free market of opportunity… for men. Is it wrong to want a husband, house, and children? No, probably not. What is wrong though, is that that’s the steady diet young girls are fed while the buffet of endless potential is given freely to the less-fare sex. ",
 blogP4: "I read the eye opening book 1984 about five years ago, and the relevance to our modern world is astonishing. Such as the concept of a thought crime. Having equality and equity across race and sex could be a modern thought crime; such that you’re deemed a progressive, an anti-conservative, an anti-traditionalist, an anti-religious, hater of men. Being on the outside of any of those groups and being called that would most likely result in a snicker and sense of pride by being given such a compliment. Whereas if you’re on the inside of any of those groups it can make you a leper, a danger to anyone that’s never been told the underlying values of feminism and pro-minorities. In a way, ideas are the most dangerous tool of any age. It can be used to weld groups together, divide a country, and most dangerously liberate the oppressed. What is the cost of progress and who is willing to pay, and who should pay? ",
 blogP5: "When I was younger, just the age of 13, I arrived at the idea that men were awful all by myself, occurring after hearing a number of horror stories of the pain men have and can cause women. Hating men is such an easy point to arrive at as a feminist pillar, but knowing your oppressor by name is a huge part of escaping imprisonment. A single prisoner that gets the chance to escape prison will flee to the high hills, but a group of prisoners with the same chance will do what they can to overthrow the whole system. And what was their crime? What is the crime of being a woman? Might I just put forth that maybe it’s by limiting the control men have over women. What fight are women currently waging except that which men don’t already have most of, if not all authority, on the subject? Not to beat a dead horse by bringing up the topics of contraception, birth control, and abortion, but the progress that’s been made in the past century to increase access and control over these is monumental, and they coincidently limit mens control to make a family and give greater control to women. ",
 blogP6: "I wasn’t raised as a feminist and have only become one as I moved away from America. It took a great deal to break down the ideologies I’ve been given my whole life. To be on the outside of America allowed me the freedom and clarity to see it as both an outsider and insider. I relocated right on the cusp of the Me Too movement, only 6 months after the 2016 election, amidst a time where a lot of craziness was going down in the country. Then I had the chance to teach English at a local French University only 45 minutes away from my city. I spent the first semester learning as much as I did teaching. The second semester I had students choose from a list of debate topics, politically and socially hot topics that featured: the death penalty, same sex marriage & adoption, slavery, euthanasia, abortion, colonization, women’s rights, immigration, decriminalization of prostitution, animal testing, and legalization of marijuana. If you ever want to learn the inner thoughts, ideas, and values of a culture ask half of them to be for these topics and the other half against. It was some of the most entertaining discussions I’ve ever been a part of, as well as heart breaking. ",
 blogP7: "I stood there listening to the countless arguments obviously many that I disagreed with and others agreed with. For the first time I put down the pitchfork of vanity that I knew everything and picked up the torch for the broken hearts of so many of my students. Most were just trying to make sense of the pain the world had dealt them and those they knew. There came a point where I had flipped on a dime. For the first time in my life I had whole heartedly let go of absolution and picked up relativity, and that’s the only way I can ever view our world from again.",
 blogP8: "So now and forever more I will be a feminist, someone who will fight for equality, equity, for both women and any minority, for anyone that’s been stepped on along the way so that others can achieve their dreams at any cost. Some things are worth letting go of everything for. The pain I saw in the eyes of my students in those discussions will forever keep my heart’s compass towards compassion and mercy. That’s all any of us ever need, to be understood, known and given compassion when others deem us unworthy of it. So hating men isn’t the fight, and neither is just the patriarchy, but to be an advocate for those who are being trampled on everyday. ",

 blogP1: "A female who’d rather spend her day with a computer than people, men, children… gasp. A few years back was the first time I verbally expressed to some friends that I wanted to get into programming. One guy actually laughed at me, saying he works with a bunch of guys that do that and I would be better in a more social role. What bothered me wasn’t just the innate sexist spin of his comment but that he reduced me to some category in his head that couldn’t exceed his current conception of me. It’s the story of all our lives right, that we’re always underestimated by those closest to us.",
 blogP2: "When I entered my 11 week program, there were only five women enrolled out of a class of thirty. Whether it be less opportunities, societal pressures, sexist fields or whatnot, the fact is that there are not many women in this field. I feel honored to be amongst so few women who have succeed and continue to strive to excel in a field where no-one looks like them. Representation is everything. I didn’t have any women in my life that I knew as powerful and successful outside of stereotypical female fields. I believe the smallest difference I’ll make is in the lives of my own children one day that they’ll have a mother that delved into a predominately male industry and found her place. ",
 blogP3: "Honestly I’ve yet to experience Tech at an industry level, so my experience is still yet limited, and I cannot wait to update this post. Until then, I’m walking arms open into the flames of one of the hardest and most competitive fields any person can get into. Ta ta for now.",
