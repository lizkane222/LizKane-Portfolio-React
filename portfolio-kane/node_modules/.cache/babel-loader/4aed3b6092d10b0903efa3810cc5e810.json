When I had finished, I was amazed by what I had done. I was most proud of the line-work around the face and the hands, even though my proportions between the two were off, I felt immense joy. There was some burst of self-recognition in that moment of both pride and an idea that ‘this thing I’ve made is now a part of me. It hadn’t existed prior but now it’s as if I found some missing piece of myself.’ That one idea, or even feeling has ever since shaped much of the way I view the world. \",\n  blogP2: \"\tI dabbled in painting with watercolors, charcoal, chalk and pastels, tried my hand at acrylic painting, but mostly I stuck with sketching. Years I spent chasing that feeling of creating something to discover new aspects of myself. There was always this place deep inside me that unified through the action of creating.\",\n  blogP3: \"\tThe next period that defined my artistic life was upon taking a trip to Wyoming. It was an emotionally complex time of my life, as it is for many 16 year olds. I took my sketchbook, pencils, and a lawn chair out to the middle of grassy hills and posted up along a trail. I’m writing this 14 years later and I can still see the lines of those drawings. As always instructed by my art teachers, you spend nearly 80% of the time looking at the object and only 20% actually compiling the piece. I spent hours in different spots facing in different directions memorizing the landscapes of a place that meant very little to me at the time, but through sketching out those rolling hills, power lines, clouds, and grasslands there was an imprinting that took place that went far beyond the weighted lines of my pencils. \",\n  blogP4: \"\tFor Buddhists, the realm of meditation comprises mental states such as calm, concentration and one-pointedness (which comprises the six forces: hearing, pondering, mindfulness, awareness, effort and intimacy). The art of meditation or better yet, the meditation through art is like the twisting of radio knobs to find the clearest frequency of my own mind. There is something therapeutic about looking so long and deep at something and then pulling back to look at its simplest shapes and curves. Then the real therapy comes when forcing those shapes and curves onto a pad that not only represents what your eye can catch, but the chaotic thoughts to be hashed out with each stroke, blend, and erased mark. \",\n  blogP5: \"\tMeditation is just a path towards liberation, awakening, mindfulness. Through sketching I journeyed through chaos to bring about order. Liberated from the puzzling and infuriating aspects of life finding closure to pain. In pouring my thoughts and heart into a piece I was unbound and released from whatever I felt imprisoned by at that moment. Liberation in creating, a.k.a. meditation, may be the one force to counteract spiritual gravity.\",\n  blogP6: \"\tYears and years have gone by and I’ve delved into drawing and painting with different motivations, sometimes creating to only then give it away, clawing out broad strokes to create a world on one of the many pages in my books. There were times when I never finished many works, as searching leads to discovery some worlds are flat with an edge to nowhere. In other words there was not a solution in the reality so how could there be an artistic one? But when I found that inspiring thought or photo to draw, I’d take ahold of it and get lost in its lights and shadows. I would take long lengths of hours and hours to paint the faintest details with the smallest paintbrush I could find. Truly I was searching for which drawing would be The accurate reflection of the world I’ve experienced and which would become a part of me.

I’ve stopped producing art for long periods of time because it’s emotionally draining to pour out and pour out and pour out.

Who didn’t right? There was this one night, I was sitting in my older sister’s bedroom on her office chair and we had the song on repeat, ‘my heart will go on an on.’ We belted out each line dramatically both seriously and humorously. I sat in that chair spinning and spinning around to no end, it was euphoric, it was timeless. I recount that night as being the night I discovered my love of singing. If you had asked my parents they’d tell you I had spent every moment before that singing instead of speaking, constantly making up songs, but this was the moment where I realized it for myself.\",\n  blogP2: \"\tThe room with the spinning chair was in a house, and that house was complicated, my family lived there for many years yet this is my only true memory of me singing in that house. Singing had become a gauge of my happiness, there were times when it would just flow out and times I wouldn’t utter a sound. This was the same with certain places and people. I became aware of this inconsistency during a relationship in my teens. I was in a place where I thought I needed to break up and during a conversation with a friend I said, ‘I just don’t sing anymore, at least not when I’m with him.’ I was young and new to relationships but that realization forged a standard for all relationships that followed. ‘How do I know I’m with the right person? The answer, do I sing when I’m with them?’ It’s the simplest of measurements but is there a truer one in life than what naturally overflows in moments of joy and comfort? In my opinion no. \",\n  blogP3: \"\tThat next year was when I began writing songs, I took my older sister’s guitar and learned three chords. I was terrible, my fingers weren’t strong, my rhythm was more than lacking, but it was a collection of notes that gave me avenues to express my thoughts and ideas. My first song was a story from a few different perspectives of teenagers. For some reason I wasn’t embarrassed to sing it to my family and friends and did just that. With each new song I’d sit in my room learning two or three new chords just different enough to inspire avenues I had never expected to discover. In general I’m not a very emotional person, or at least I’d say so about myself. What I really mean is that my face may be overly-expressive, that which I wish I could control, but when it came down to my inner-thoughts those I rarely expressed to others; that was until I began writing. I allowed myself to feel and process things I wouldn’t have otherwise, all for the sake of the music. To get it out on paper I was purging myself of all of my complicated emotions and thoughts, and for the first time would untangle the mess and weave it into my own subjective truth.\",\n  blogP4: \"\tThe whole process of song writing is something I think everyone should experience. In the beginning I came up with different techniques of writing, draw up chords first then write, write lines then modify them with chords, journal and pull out common threads, but the most truthful one: find chords and don’t plan, just sing. I had done this so many times that most of the songs I have sung weren’t ever written down, and they didn’t need to be because the pure experience flushed out the words I needed at that moment. I’d play and sing, dust off my hands and come out revived.\",\n  blogP5: \"\tI have a collection of dozens and dozens of songs, showing my different levels of maturity and whatever obsession rented out the space of my mind at that time. I have written songs of love, heartbreak, confusion, grief, hope, but if you looked throughout them they’d all have a common thread, me questioning why and the quest of finding the assurance I needed to go on. Why write songs? I don’t know any song writers who sit down to write and know exactly from start to finish what the song will be. The direction maybe, but the whole picture only comes about in its compilation. Each line, stanza, verse, and chorus holds different levels of truth. To find the truth you’ve got to set up camp until the fire goes out. Music metaphorically became the technique that cleansed me of life’s toxins.

What is the cost of progress and who is willing to pay, and who should pay? \",\n  blogP5: \"When I was younger, just the age of 13, I arrived at the idea that men were awful all by myself, occurring after hearing a number of horror stories of the pain men have and can cause women. Hating men is such an easy point to arrive at as a feminist pillar, but knowing your oppressor by name is a huge part of escaping imprisonment. A single prisoner that gets the chance to escape prison will flee to the high hills, but a group of prisoners with the same chance will do what they can to overthrow the whole system. And what was their crime? What is the crime of being a woman? Might I just put forth that maybe it’s by limiting the control men have over women. What fight are women currently waging except that which men don’t already have most of, if not all authority, on the subject? Not to beat a dead horse by bringing up the topics of contraception, birth control, and abortion, but the progress that’s been made in the past century to increase access and control over these is monumental, and they coincidently limit mens control to make a family and give greater control to women. \",\n  blogP6: \"I wasn’t raised as a feminist and have only become one as I moved away from America. It took a great deal to break down the ideologies I’ve been given my whole life. To be on the outside of America allowed me the freedom and clarity to see it as both an outsider and insider. I relocated right on the cusp of the Me Too movement, only 6 months after the 2016 election, amidst a time where a lot of craziness was going down in the country. Then I had the chance to teach English at a local French University only 45 minutes away from my city. I spent the first semester learning as much as I did teaching. The second semester I had students choose from a list of debate topics, politically and socially hot topics that featured: the death penalty, same sex marriage & adoption, slavery, euthanasia, abortion, colonization, women’s rights, immigration, decriminalization of prostitution, animal testing, and legalization of marijuana. If you ever want to learn the inner thoughts, ideas, and values of a culture ask half of them to be for these topics and the other half against. It was some of the most entertaining discussions I’ve ever been a part of, as well as heart breaking. \",\n  blogP7: \"I stood there listening to the countless arguments obviously many that I disagreed with and others agreed with. For the first time I put down the pitchfork of vanity that I knew everything and picked up the torch for the broken hearts of so many of my students. Most were just trying to make sense of the pain the world had dealt them and those they knew. There came a point where I had flipped on a dime. For the first time in my life I had whole heartedly let go of absolution and picked up relativity, and that’s the only way I can ever view our world from again.\",\n  blogP8: \"So now and forever more I will be a feminist, someone who will fight for equality, equity, for both women and any minority, for anyone that’s been stepped on along the way so that others can achieve their dreams at any cost. Some things are worth letting go of everything for. The pain I saw in the eyes of my students in those discussions will forever keep my heart’s compass towards compassion and mercy. That’s all any of us ever need, to be understood, known and given compassion when others deem us unworthy of it. So hating men isn’t the fight, and neither is just the patriarchy, but to be an advocate for those who are being trampled on everyday. \",\n  blogP9: \"\",\n  blogP10: \"\",\n  blogP11: \"\",\n  blogP12: \"\",\n  blogP13: \"\",\n  blogP14: \"\",\n  blogP15: \"\",\n  blogP16: \"\",\n  blogP17: \"\",\n  blogP18: \"\",\n  blogP19: \"\",\n  blogP20: \"\",\n  //  imgSrc: \"../ResourcesProjects/UploadPhotosToWeb/blog/flowersWoman.jpg\",\n  imgSrc: Feminist,\n  imgDesc: \"\"\n}];\nconst BlogPostWomanInTech = [{\n  title: \"A Woman In Tech\",\n  index: 8,\n  blogP1: \"A female who’d rather spend her day with a computer than people, men, children… gasp.

One guy actually laughed at me, saying he works with a bunch of guys that do that and I would be better in a more social role. What bothered me wasn’t just the innate sexist spin of his comment but that he reduced me to some category in his head that couldn’t exceed his current conception of me.

I didn’t have any women in my life that I knew as powerful and successful outside of stereotypical female fields.

There was some burst of self-recognition in that moment of both pride and an idea that ‘this thing I’ve made is now a part of me. It hadn’t existed prior but now it’s as if I found some missing piece of myself.’ That one idea, or even feeling has ever since shaped much of the way I view the world. \",\n blogP2: \"\tI dabbled in painting with watercolors, charcoal, chalk and pastels, tried my hand at acrylic painting, but mostly I stuck with sketching. Years I spent chasing that feeling of creating something to discover new aspects of myself. There was always this place deep inside me that unified through the action of creating.\",\n blogP3: \"\tThe next period that defined my artistic life was upon taking a trip to Wyoming. It was an emotionally complex time of my life, as it is for many 16 year olds. I took my sketchbook, pencils, and a lawn chair out to the middle of grassy hills and posted up along a trail. I’m writing this 14 years later and I can still see the lines of those drawings. As always instructed by my art teachers, you spend nearly 80% of the time looking at the object and only 20% actually compiling the piece. I spent hours in different spots facing in different directions memorizing the landscapes of a place that meant very little to me at the time, but through sketching out those rolling hills, power lines, clouds, and grasslands there was an imprinting that took place that went far beyond the weighted lines of my pencils. \",\n blogP4: \"\tFor Buddhists, the realm of meditation comprises mental states such as calm, concentration and one-pointedness (which comprises the six forces: hearing, pondering, mindfulness, awareness, effort and intimacy). The art of meditation or better yet, the meditation through art is like the twisting of radio knobs to find the clearest frequency of my own mind. There is something therapeutic about looking so long and deep at something and then pulling back to look at its simplest shapes and curves. Then the real therapy comes when forcing those shapes and curves onto a pad that not only represents what your eye can catch, but the chaotic thoughts to be hashed out with each stroke, blend, and erased mark. \",\n blogP5: \"\tMeditation is just a path towards liberation, awakening, mindfulness. Through sketching I journeyed through chaos to bring about order. Liberated from the puzzling and infuriating aspects of life finding closure to pain. In pouring my thoughts and heart into a piece I was unbound and released from whatever I felt imprisoned by at that moment. Liberation in creating, a.k.a. meditation, may be the one force to counteract spiritual gravity.\",\n blogP6: \"\tYears and years have gone by and I’ve delved into drawing and painting with different motivations, sometimes creating to only then give it away, clawing out broad strokes to create a world on one of the many pages in my books. There were times when I never finished many works, as searching leads to discovery some worlds are flat with an edge to nowhere. In other words there was not a solution in the reality so how could there be an artistic one? But when I found that inspiring thought or photo to draw, I’d take ahold of it and get lost in its lights and shadows. I would take long lengths of hours and hours to paint the faintest details with the smallest paintbrush I could find. Truly I was searching for which drawing would be The accurate reflection of the world I’ve experienced and which would become a part of me. It’s like I was speed dating my way through art pieces looking to marry the one that complimented me most. To that end, I may always be a spinster.\",\n blogP7: \"\tAs adventurous as it is to always be discovering more of myself, it’s exhausting. I’ve stopped producing art for long periods of time because it’s emotionally draining to pour out and pour out and pour out. Even more so when I create pieces to just give them away… If my art could speak it’d be politely and timidly asking, ‘do you see me now?’, ‘do you understand me now?’, and most of all ‘in giving you this, I want you to know I see you and have spent hours thinking over you.

Who didn’t right? There was this one night, I was sitting in my older sister’s bedroom on her office chair and we had the song on repeat, ‘my heart will go on an on.’ We belted out each line dramatically both seriously and humorously. I sat in that chair spinning and spinning around to no end, it was euphoric, it was timeless. I recount that night as being the night I discovered my love of singing. If you had asked my parents they’d tell you I had spent every moment before that singing instead of speaking, constantly making up songs, but this was the moment where I realized it for myself.\",\n blogP2: \"\tThe room with the spinning chair was in a house, and that house was complicated, my family lived there for many years yet this is my only true memory of me singing in that house. Singing had become a gauge of my happiness, there were times when it would just flow out and times I wouldn’t utter a sound. This was the same with certain places and people. I became aware of this inconsistency during a relationship in my teens. I was in a place where I thought I needed to break up and during a conversation with a friend I said, ‘I just don’t sing anymore, at least not when I’m with him.’ I was young and new to relationships but that realization forged a standard for all relationships that followed. ‘How do I know I’m with the right person? The answer, do I sing when I’m with them?’ It’s the simplest of measurements but is there a truer one in life than what naturally overflows in moments of joy and comfort? In my opinion no. \",\n blogP3: \"\tThat next year was when I began writing songs, I took my older sister’s guitar and learned three chords. I was terrible, my fingers weren’t strong, my rhythm was more than lacking, but it was a collection of notes that gave me avenues to express my thoughts and ideas. My first song was a story from a few different perspectives of teenagers. For some reason I wasn’t embarrassed to sing it to my family and friends and did just that. With each new song I’d sit in my room learning two or three new chords just different enough to inspire avenues I had never expected to discover. In general I’m not a very emotional person, or at least I’d say so about myself. What I really mean is that my face may be overly-expressive, that which I wish I could control, but when it came down to my inner-thoughts those I rarely expressed to others; that was until I began writing. I allowed myself to feel and process things I wouldn’t have otherwise, all for the sake of the music. To get it out on paper I was purging myself of all of my complicated emotions and thoughts, and for the first time would untangle the mess and weave it into my own subjective truth.\",\n blogP4: \"\tThe whole process of song writing is something I think everyone should experience. In the beginning I came up with different techniques of writing, draw up chords first then write, write lines then modify them with chords, journal and pull out common threads, but the most truthful one: find chords and don’t plan, just sing. I had done this so many times that most of the songs I have sung weren’t ever written down, and they didn’t need to be because the pure experience flushed out the words I needed at that moment. I’d play and sing, dust off my hands and come out revived.\",\n blogP5: \"\tI have a collection of dozens and dozens of songs, showing my different levels of maturity and whatever obsession rented out the space of my mind at that time. I have written songs of love, heartbreak, confusion, grief, hope, but if you looked throughout them they’d all have a common thread, me questioning why and the quest of finding the assurance I needed to go on. Why write songs? I don’t know any song writers who sit down to write and know exactly from start to finish what the song will be. The direction maybe, but the whole picture only comes about in its compilation. Each line, stanza, verse, and chorus holds different levels of truth. To find the truth you’ve got to set up camp until the fire goes out. Music metaphorically became the technique that cleansed me of life’s toxins.

What bothered me wasn’t just the innate sexist spin of his comment but that he reduced me to some category in his head that couldn’t exceed his current conception of me. It’s the story of all our lives right, that we’re always underestimated by those closest to us.\",\n blogP2: \"When I entered my 11 week program, there were only five women enrolled out of a class of thirty. Whether it be less opportunities, societal pressures, sexist fields or whatnot, the fact is that there are not many women in this field. I feel honored to be amongst so few women who have succeed and continue to strive to excel in a field where no-one looks like them. Representation is everything. I didn’t have any women in my life that I knew as powerful and successful outside of stereotypical female fields. I believe the smallest difference I’ll make is in the lives of my own children one day that they’ll have a mother that delved into a predominately male industry and found her place. \",\n blogP3: \"Honestly I’ve yet to experience Tech at an industry level, so my experience is still yet limited, and I cannot wait to update this post. Until then, I’m walking arms open into the flames of one of the hardest and most competitive fields any person can get into. Ta ta for now.\",\n blogP4: \"\",\n blogP5: \"\",\n blogP6: \"\",\n blogP7: \"\",\n blogP8: \"\",\n blogP9: \"\",\n blogP10: \"\",\n blogP11: \"\",\n blogP12: \"\",\n blogP13: \"\",\n blogP14: \"\",\n
