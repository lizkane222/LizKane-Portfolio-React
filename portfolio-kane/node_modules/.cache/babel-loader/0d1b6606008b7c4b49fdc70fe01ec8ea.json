Possible Roadblocks\n// Here, you’ll want to outline any roadblocks, such as limited resources or a custom website, that might prevent certain vendors from successfully completing the project. This allows you to eliminate unsatisfactory bidders, and it will also help you determine which vendors have the skills and expertise to tackle those challenges.\n// 9. Budget\n// Any vendor needs to know how much you’re able to pay them for their services before they’ll move forward with their bid.\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"WorkPage\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/lizkane/Desktop/GA/SEI/Projects/2ReactPortfolio/portfolio-app-2/src/Pages/WorkPage.jsx"],"names":["React","Wrapper","styled","ReqForProj","Desert","WorkPage","props","setActive","e","stopPropagation"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,OAAP,MAAoB,8BAApB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,mBAAnB;AAEA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,sGAAvB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,mEAAnB,C,CAGA;;AAGA,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAC,MAAM;AACjB,sBACI;AAAS,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,UAAZ;AAAA,2BACI,QAAC,OAAD;AAAA,8BACI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;AAAA,+BACI;AAAK,UAAA,GAAG,EAAED,MAAV;AAAkB,UAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAAtB;AAAyB,UAAA,EAAE,EAAC,WAA5B;AAAwC,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC;AAAlD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADJ,eAW4B;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAf;AAAoC,QAAA,OAAO,EAAEE,KAAK,CAACC,SAAnD;AAAA,+BAC5B;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;AAA6B,UAAA,OAAO,EAAGC,CAAD,IAAOA,CAAC,CAACC,eAAF,EAA7C;AAAA,iCACI;AAAK,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;AAAA,oCACI;AAAI,cAAA,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBADJ,eAEI;AAAI,cAAA,SAAS,EAAC,cAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAFJ,eAG4B;AAAK,cAAA,EAAE,EAAC,iBAAR;AAAA,sCACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAFJ,eAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAHJ,eAII;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAJJ,eAKI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBALJ,eAMI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBANJ,eAOI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAPJ,eAQI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBARJ,eASI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBATJ,eAUI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAVJ,eAWI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAXJ,eAYI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAZJ,eAaI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAbJ,eAcI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAdJ,eAeI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAfJ,eAgBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAhBJ,eAiBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAjBJ,eAkBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAlBJ,eAmBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAnBJ,eAoBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBApBJ,eAqBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBArBJ,eAsBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAtBJ,eAuBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAvBJ,eAwBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAxBJ,eAyBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAzBJ,eA0BI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBA1BJ,eA2BI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBA3BJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAH5B,eAgC4B;AAAK,cAAA,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAf;AAAA,qCACI;AAAQ,gBAAA,EAAE,EAAC,eAAX;AAA2B,gBAAA,SAAS,EAAC,cAArC;AAAoD,gBAAA,KAAK,EAAC,qBAA1D;AAAgF,gBAAA,GAAG,EAAEN,UAArF;AAAiG,gBAAA,KAAK,EAAC,MAAvG;AAA8G,gBAAA,MAAM,EAAC,KAArH;AAA2H,gBAAA,WAAW,EAAC,GAAvI;AAA2I,gBAAA,eAAe;AAA1J;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAhC5B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAD4B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAX5B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADJ;AA4DH,CA7DD;;KAAME,Q;AA+DN,eAAeA,QAAf,C,CAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AACA","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\nimport Wrapper from '../components/Header/Wrapper';\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\n\nimport ReqForProj from \"../components/ResourcesProjects/UploadPhotosToWeb/docs/FillableRequestForProjectProposalTemplate.pdf\"\nimport Desert from \"../components/ResourcesProjects/UploadPhotosToWeb/docs/desert.png\";\n\n\n// const WorkPageStyled = styled.div;\n\n\nconst WorkPage=() => {\n    return(\n        <section id=\"workPage\">\n            <Wrapper>\n                <div className=\"redbox\">\n                    <img src={Desert} alt=\"\" id=\"desertImg\" className=\"thematicImg responsive-img box-shadow\"/>\n                </div>\n                {/* <div onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n                    <div className=\"wrapperFloatBlogBox\">\n                        <div className=\"floatBlogBox\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n                            <div className=\"blogContainer animate\"> \n                                <div id=\"blogContainer\">\n                                    <div id=\"blogListContainer\">\n                                        <ul id=\"blogListUL\"> */}\n                                        <div className=\"wrapperFloatDocBox\" onClick={props.setActive}>\n            <div className=\"floatDocBox\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n                <div className=\"resourceDiv\"  >\n                    <h3 className=\"resourceCategory\">BACK</h3>\n                    <h2 className=\"resourceName\">Request For Project</h2>\n                                            <div id=\"rfpInstructions\">\n                                                <h3>1.
