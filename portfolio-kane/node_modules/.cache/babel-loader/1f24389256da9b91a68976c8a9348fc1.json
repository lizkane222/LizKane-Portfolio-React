When I had finished, I was amazed by what I had done. I was most amazed by the line-work around the face and the hands, even though my proportions between the two were off, I felt immense joy. There was some burst of self-recognition in that moment of both pride and an idea that ‘this thing I had made is now a part of me. It hadn’t existed prior but now it’s like I found a lost scrap of myself.’ That one idea, or even feeling has ever since shaped much of the way I view the world. \",blogP2:\"\tI dabbled in painting with watercolors, charcoal, chalk and pastels, tried my hand at acrylic painting, but mostly I stuck with sketching. Years I spent chasing that feeling of creating something so that I could get part of myself back. Not that I had lost anything, but there was more of me out there that I’ve yet to discover. There was always this place deep inside me that unified through the action of creating. \",blogP3:\"\tThe next period that defined my artistic life was upon taking a trip to Wyoming. It was an emotionally complex time of my life, as it is for many 16 year olds. I took my sketchbook, pencils, and a lawn chair out to the middle of grassy hills and posted up along a trail. I’m writing this 13 years later and I can still see and feel the lines of those drawings. As always instructed by my art teachers, you spend nearly 80% of the time looking at the object and only 20% actually compiling the piece. I spent hours in different spots facing in different directions memorizing the landscapes of a place that meant very little to me at the time, but through  sketching out the rolling hills, power lines, clouds, and grasslands there was an imprinting that took place that went far beyond the weighted lines of my pencils. There was something therapeutic about looking so deep at a thing and then pulling back out to look at its most simple shapes and curves. Then the real therapy comes when forcing those shapes and curves onto a pad that not only represents what your eye can catch, but the tumultuous feelings that would be hashed out with each stroke, blend, and erased mark. \",blogP4:\"\tNot to be overly dramatic, but it’s as if I was saying, ‘if I could pour out my heart to see its contents, maybe then I could find a solution to this ever increasing complex world around me. It would take seeing those contents to find closure to my pain, resolution to the puzzling and infuriating aspects of life.’ These drawings became that for me. In pouring my thoughts and heart into a piece I was unbound and released from whatever I felt imprisoned by at that moment. Liberation in creation may be the one force to counteract spiritual gravity. \",blogP5:\"\tYears and years have gone by and I’ve delved into drawing and painting with different motivations, sometimes creating to only then give it away, clawing out broad strokes to flee pain, and then other times grasping at life’s joys to collect them on one of the many pages of my books. There were times when I never finished many works because there was no real-life solution so how could there be an artistic one? But when I found that inspiring thought or photo to draw, I’d take ahold of it and get lost in its lights and shadows. I would take long lengths of hours and hours to paint the faintest details with the smallest paintbrush I could find. Truly I was searching, which drawing would be The accurate reflection of the world I’ve experienced and which would become a part of me. It’s like I was speed dating my way through art pieces looking to marry the one that complimented me most. To that end, I may always be a spinster. \",blogP6:\"\tAs adventurous as it is to always be discovering more of myself, it’s exhausting. I’ve stopped producing art for long periods of time because it’s emotionally draining to pour out and pour out and pour out. Even more so when I create pieces to just give them away. If my art could speak it’d be politely and timidly asking, ‘do you see me now?’, ‘do you understand me now?’, and most of all ‘in giving you this, I want you to know I see you and have spent hours thinking over you. In a way you’ve become a part of me, who I am as more than just an artist.’ \",blogP7:\"\",blogP8:\"\",blogP9:\"\",blogP10:\"\",blogP11:\"\",blogP12:\"\",blogP13:\"\",blogP14:\"\",blogP15:\"\",blogP16:\"\",blogP17:\"\",blogP18:\"\",blogP19:\"\",blogP20:\"\",//  imgSrc: \"../Room/UploadPhotosToWeb/blog/whitePaint.jpg\",\nimgSrc:Artist,imgDesc:\"\"}];var BlogPostMusician=[{title:\"A Musician Like Me \",blogP1:\"\tI had just seen Titanic and fell in love with its theme song, who didn’t right? There was this one night I was sitting in my older sister’s bedroom on her office chair and we had the song on repeat, ‘my heart will go on an on.’ We belted out each line dramatically both seriously and humorously. I sat in that chair spinning and spinning around to no end, it was euphoric, it was timeless. I recount that night as being the night I discovered my love of singing. If you had asked my parents they’d tell you I had spent every moment before that singing instead of speaking, constantly making up songs, but this was the moment where I realized it for myself. \",blogP2:\"\tThe room with the spinning chair was in a house, and that house was complicated, my family lived there for many years yet this is my only true memory of me singing in that house. Singing had become a gauge of my happiness, there were times when it would just flow out and times I wouldn’t utter a sound. This was the same with certain places and people. I became aware of this inconsistency during a relationship in my teens. I was in a place where I thought I needed to break up with him and during a conversation with a friend I said, ‘I just don’t sing anymore, at least not when I’m with him.’ I was young and new to relationships but that realization forged a standard for all relationships that followed. ‘How do I know I’m with the right person? The answer, do I sing when I’m with them?’ It’s the simplest of measurements but is there a truer one in life than what naturally overflows in moments of joy and comfort? In my opinion no.  \",blogP3:\"\tThat next year was when I began writing songs, I took my older sister’s guitar and learned three chords. I was terrible, my fingers weren’t strong, my rhythm was more than lacking, but it was a collection of notes that gave me avenues to express my thoughts and ideas. My first song was a story from a few different perspectives of teenagers. For some reason I wasn’t embarrassed to sing it to my family and friends and did just that. With each new song I’d sit in my room learning two or three new chords just different enough to inspire avenues I had never expected to discover. In general I’m not a very emotional person, or at least I’d say so about myself. What I really mean is that my face may be overly-expressive but you’ll never hear the thoughts behind those expressions; that was until I began writing. I allowed myself to feel and process things I wouldn’t have otherwise, all for the sake of the music. To get it out on paper I was purging myself of all of my complicated emotions and thoughts, for the first time would untangle the mess and weave it into my own subjective truth. \",blogP4:\"\tThe whole process of song writing is something I think everyone should experience. In the beginning I came up with different techniques of writing, draw up chords first then write, writes lines then modify them with chords, journal and pull out common threads, but the most truthful one: find chords and don’t plan, just sing. I had done this so many times that most of the songs I have sung weren’t ever written down, and they didn’t need to be because the pure experience flushed out the words I needed at that moment. I’d play and sing, dust off my hands and come out revived. \",blogP5:\"\tI have a collection of dozens and dozens of songs, showing my different levels of maturity and whatever obsession rented out the space of my mind at that time. I have written songs of love, heartbreak, confusion, grief, hope, but if you looked throughout them they’d all have a common thread, me questioning why and the quest of finding the assurance I needed to go on. Why write songs? I don’t know any song writers who sit down to write and know exactly from start to finish what the song will be. The direction maybe, but the whole picture only comes about in its compilation. Each line, stanza, verse, and chorus holds different levels of truth. To find the truth you’ve got to set up camp until the fire goes out. Music metaphorically became the technique that cleansed me of life’s toxins. My songs pulse with the beat of my heart, forever gauging my happiness, dissatisfaction, and the landscape of experiences throughout my life.

When I had finished, I was amazed by what I had done. I was most amazed by the line-work around the face and the hands, even though my proportions between the two were off, I felt immense joy. There was some burst of self-recognition in that moment of both pride and an idea that ‘this thing I had made is now a part of me. It hadn’t existed prior but now it’s like I found a lost scrap of myself.’ That one idea, or even feeling has ever since shaped much of the way I view the world. \",\n blogP2: \"\tI dabbled in painting with watercolors, charcoal, chalk and pastels, tried my hand at acrylic painting, but mostly I stuck with sketching. Years I spent chasing that feeling of creating something so that I could get part of myself back. Not that I had lost anything, but there was more of me out there that I’ve yet to discover. There was always this place deep inside me that unified through the action of creating. \",\n blogP3: \"\tThe next period that defined my artistic life was upon taking a trip to Wyoming. It was an emotionally complex time of my life, as it is for many 16 year olds. I took my sketchbook, pencils, and a lawn chair out to the middle of grassy hills and posted up along a trail. I’m writing this 13 years later and I can still see and feel the lines of those drawings. As always instructed by my art teachers, you spend nearly 80% of the time looking at the object and only 20% actually compiling the piece. I spent hours in different spots facing in different directions memorizing the landscapes of a place that meant very little to me at the time, but through  sketching out the rolling hills, power lines, clouds, and grasslands there was an imprinting that took place that went far beyond the weighted lines of my pencils. There was something therapeutic about looking so deep at a thing and then pulling back out to look at its most simple shapes and curves. Then the real therapy comes when forcing those shapes and curves onto a pad that not only represents what your eye can catch, but the tumultuous feelings that would be hashed out with each stroke, blend, and erased mark. \",\n blogP4: \"\tNot to be overly dramatic, but it’s as if I was saying, ‘if I could pour out my heart to see its contents, maybe then I could find a solution to this ever increasing complex world around me. It would take seeing those contents to find closure to my pain, resolution to the puzzling and infuriating aspects of life.’ These drawings became that for me. In pouring my thoughts and heart into a piece I was unbound and released from whatever I felt imprisoned by at that moment. Liberation in creation may be the one force to counteract spiritual gravity. \",\n blogP5: \"\tYears and years have gone by and I’ve delved into drawing and painting with different motivations, sometimes creating to only then give it away, clawing out broad strokes to flee pain, and then other times grasping at life’s joys to collect them on one of the many pages of my books. There were times when I never finished many works because there was no real-life solution so how could there be an artistic one? But when I found that inspiring thought or photo to draw, I’d take ahold of it and get lost in its lights and shadows. I would take long lengths of hours and hours to paint the faintest details with the smallest paintbrush I could find. Truly I was searching, which drawing would be The accurate reflection of the world I’ve experienced and which would become a part of me. It’s like I was speed dating my way through art pieces looking to marry the one that complimented me most. To that end, I may always be a spinster. \",\n blogP6: \"\tAs adventurous as it is to always be discovering more of myself, it’s exhausting. I’ve stopped producing art for long periods of time because it’s emotionally draining to pour out and pour out and pour out. Even more so when I create pieces to just give them away. If my art could speak it’d be politely and timidly asking, ‘do you see me now?’, ‘do you understand me now?’, and most of all ‘in giving you this, I want you to know I see you and have spent hours thinking over you. In a way you’ve become a part of me, who I am as more than just an artist.’ \",\n blogP7: \"\",\n blogP8: \"\",\n blogP9: \"\",\n blogP10: \"\",\n blogP11: \"\",\n blogP12: \"\",\n blogP13: \"\",\n blogP14: \"\",\n blogP15: \"\",\n blogP16: \"\",\n blogP17: \"\",\n blogP18: \"\",\n blogP19: \"\",\n blogP20: \"\", \n//  imgSrc: \"../Room/UploadPhotosToWeb/blog/whitePaint.jpg\",\n imgSrc: Artist,\n imgDesc: \"\",\n \n}]\n\nconst BlogPostMusician = [{\n title: \"A Musician Like Me \",\n blogP1: \"\tI had just seen Titanic and fell in love with its theme song, who didn’t right? There was this one night I was sitting in my older sister’s bedroom on her office chair and we had the song on repeat, ‘my heart will go on an on.’ We belted out each line dramatically both seriously and humorously. I sat in that chair spinning and spinning around to no end, it was euphoric, it was timeless. I recount that night as being the night I discovered my love of singing. If you had asked my parents they’d tell you I had spent every moment before that singing instead of speaking, constantly making up songs, but this was the moment where I realized it for myself. \",\n blogP2: \"\tThe room with the spinning chair was in a house, and that house was complicated, my family lived there for many years yet this is my only true memory of me singing in that house. Singing had become a gauge of my happiness, there were times when it would just flow out and times I wouldn’t utter a sound. This was the same with certain places and people. I became aware of this inconsistency during a relationship in my teens. I was in a place where I thought I needed to break up with him and during a conversation with a friend I said, ‘I just don’t sing anymore, at least not when I’m with him.’ I was young and new to relationships but that realization forged a standard for all relationships that followed. ‘How do I know I’m with the right person? The answer, do I sing when I’m with them?’ It’s the simplest of measurements but is there a truer one in life than what naturally overflows in moments of joy and comfort? In my opinion no.  \",\n blogP3: \"\tThat next year was when I began writing songs, I took my older sister’s guitar and learned three chords. I was terrible, my fingers weren’t strong, my rhythm was more than lacking, but it was a collection of notes that gave me avenues to express my thoughts and ideas. My first song was a story from a few different perspectives of teenagers. For some reason I wasn’t embarrassed to sing it to my family and friends and did just that. With each new song I’d sit in my room learning two or three new chords just different enough to inspire avenues I had never expected to discover. In general I’m not a very emotional person, or at least I’d say so about myself. What I really mean is that my face may be overly-expressive but you’ll never hear the thoughts behind those expressions; that was until I began writing. I allowed myself to feel and process things I wouldn’t have otherwise, all for the sake of the music. To get it out on paper I was purging myself of all of my complicated emotions and thoughts, for the first time would untangle the mess and weave it into my own subjective truth. \",\n blogP4: \"\tThe whole process of song writing is something I think everyone should experience. In the beginning I came up with different techniques of writing, draw up chords first then write, writes lines then modify them with chords, journal and pull out common threads, but the most truthful one: find chords and don’t plan, just sing. I had done this so many times that most of the songs I have sung weren’t ever written down, and they didn’t need to be because the pure experience flushed out the words I needed at that moment. I’d play and sing, dust off my hands and come out revived. \",\n blogP5: \"\tI have a collection of dozens and dozens of songs, showing my different levels of maturity and whatever obsession rented out the space of my mind at that time. I have written songs of love, heartbreak, confusion, grief, hope, but if you looked throughout them they’d all have a common thread, me questioning why and the quest of finding the assurance I needed to go on. Why write songs? I don’t know any song writers who sit down to write and know exactly from start to finish what the song will be. The direction maybe, but the whole picture only comes about in its compilation. Each line, stanza, verse, and chorus holds different levels of truth. To find the truth you’ve got to set up camp until the fire goes out. Music metaphorically became the technique that cleansed me of life’s toxins. My songs pulse with the beat of my heart, forever gauging my happiness, dissatisfaction, and the landscape of experiences throughout my life.  \",\n blogP6: \"\",\n blogP7: \"\",\n blogP8: \"\",\n
